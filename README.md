## "How do you feel, my dear (P8)" - Emotion detection
Recently, emotion detection in text has received attention in the literature on sentiment analysis. Detecting emotions is important for studying human communication in different domains, including fictional scripts for TV series and movies. The project aims at studying fictional scripts of several movies and TV series under the emotional profile. In particular, the task of the project is threefold:
1. Create a model to predict emotions in text using available dataset WASSA-2017 as training set;
2. Emotions may be represented either as categorical classes or in a continuous space;
3. Exploit the model to study an emotional profile of the main characters in one of the movies included in the Cornell Movie--Dialogs Corpus;
4. Study how this emotional profile changes in time along the evolution of the movie story and how it is affected by the various relations among the different characters.

Dataset
For training and validating the model, see WASSA-2017.
For the movie and TV series dialogues, see the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus.
